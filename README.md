# Barcode-Printer

Python project for printing 1-D EAN-13 and EAN-8 Barcodes enabled with User-friendly GUI made using Tkinter. The Barcode follows the standards laid by GS1 and can be successfully Scanned using a Barcode Scanner. They are the longest-established and most widely-used of all GS1 barcodes. Both the encoding techniques were implemented from scratch and Turtle was used for printing the barcodes.
